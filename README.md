# DSA Interview Prep

This repository contains my personal Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interview preparation journey. It includes implementations of various data structures, algorithms, systems design notes/examples, and coding challenge solutions to help sharpen problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Note

I will be continuously updating this repository as I go through my self-study, adding new data structures, algorithms, systems design concepts, and solving more coding challenges along the way. Check back for new content as I progress through my preparation.

## Contents

### Data Structures

- Custom-built implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, heaps, and hash tables.

### Algorithms

- Algorithms implemented from scratch, including searching, sorting, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms.

### Systems Design

- Notes, diagrams, and example problems related to systems design concepts, including scalability, database design, load balancing, and microservices architecture.

### LeetCode/Grokking Challenges

- Solutions to popular interview questions and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, Grokking the Coding Interview, and others.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-interview-prep.git
    ```

2. Navigate to a specific folder to explore the data structures, algorithms, or challenges you're interested in. Each folder contains well-documented code and explanations to help you understand the implementation.

3. Feel free to use the code for reference or improve upon it. Contributions, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome!

## Structure

- `data_structures/`: Contains folders for each custom-built data structure (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks)
- `algorithms/`: Implements various algorithms with examples and explanations (e.g., sorting algorithms, dynamic programming)
- `systems_design/`: Notes and examples of systems design problems and solutions
- `challenges/`: Solutions for coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, Grokking the Coding Interview, and others

## Example

Here's an example of how to use one of the data structures (e.g., a custom-built stack):

```python
from data_structures.stack import Stack

# Initialize the stack
stack = Stack()

# Push elements onto the stack
stack.push(10)
stack.push(20)

# Pop an element from the stack
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 20
```
